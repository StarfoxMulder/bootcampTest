				<p>Hi Everyone! I was rasied in the Morrisville/Cary area then moved to DC in 2011 where I worked for an educational nonprofit for 4 years.  Life was incredible up there, where I was fortunate enough to work with many of my best friends toward goals we were passionate about -- however, this also inclined us all to work working 50-70hr work weeks.  Eventually it became too much and I quit to spend time with my pup, play Ingress around the city, and generally enjoy life at a slower pace while I taught myself the basics of several programming languages.  A month or so ago my mom notified me of the UNC Coding Boot Camp and I became all about moving back home to attend.  Looking forward to coding with y'all!
